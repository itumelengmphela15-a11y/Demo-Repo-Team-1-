### Project Sim – Intelligent Banking Microservice Simulation

### Problem Statement

Modern banking systems face increasing demands for scalability, security, and intelligent automation to meet user expectations and regulatory requirements. Traditional monolithic architectures struggle to handle these demands, leading to inefficiencies, poor scalability, and limited adaptability to emerging technologies like AI and data analytics. Additionally, fraud detection and risk management remain critical challenges that require real-time analysis and proactive intervention.

This project aims to simulate a modern digital banking platform using microservices architecture, shared data infrastructure, and intelligent automation powered by AI and data science. The goal is to address these challenges while fostering collaboration between developers, data scientists, and AI engineers.

### Aim of the Project

The primary aim of FNB Project Sim is to create a realistic simulation of a modern banking system that integrates:

1.	Microservices Architecture: Scalable, modular backend services for core banking functionalities.

2.	Shared Data Warehouse: Centralized repository for transactional data, enabling analytics and AI-driven insights.

3.	Intelligent Automation: Agentic AI for real-time decision-making, anomaly detection, and fraud prevention
  
4.	Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration: Hands-on experience for students in AI, Data Science, and Development to work together on a unified system.


By the end of the project, students will have built a functional, secure, and scalable banking simulation that demonstrates the power of modern technologies and teamwork.

### Roles & Responsibilities

#### Data Scientists

  
  - Role: Analyze transactional data, build predictive models, and deliver actionable insights.

  
  - Tasks:
  
    - Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on transaction patterns, spending behavior, and risk indicators.

    - Develop predictive models for:

    - Forecasting income vs. expenses.


- Detecting “spreading” (large inflow followed by rapid outflows).

  - Identifying high-risk accounts.

  - Provide a fraud detection API that flags suspicious transactions in real time.


- Interaction Points:

  - Share insights and models with Developers for integration into the system.
  
  - Collaborate with AI Engineers to refine agentic AI decision-making


### Amendments:

- Fraud modelling e.g. Quick money in and then spreading the funds in micro-transactions.


### Agile Methodology

The project will follow an Agile methodology with bi-weekly sprints. Each sprint will include:


1.	Planning: Define goals and tasks for the sprint.


2.	Development: Teams work on their assigned tasks.


3.	Testing: Conduct unit, integration, and scenario testing.


4.	Presentation: Teams present their progress to stakeholders and peers.


### System Roles

The following roles will interact with the system:

1.	End Users:

  - Perform actions like login, payment initiation, and transaction tracking.

  - Benefit from a seamless, secure, and intuitive user experience.


2.	Administrators:

  - Manage user accounts and monitor flagged activities.

  - Access analytics dashboards for insights into transaction patterns.
  

3.	Fraud Analysts:

  -	Investigate flagged transactions and accounts.

  -	Collaborate with AI Engineers to refine fraud detection logic.


4.	Developers & DevOps:

  -	Maintain and scale the system.

  -	Ensure reliability and performance under varying loads.


5.	Data Scientists & AI Engineers:

  -	Continuously improve fraud detection and AI decision-making.

  -	Analyze trends and provide actionable insights.



### Expected Outcomes

By the end of the project, students will have:

1.	A fully functional, modular microservice architecture.


2.	A working agentic AI system capable of autonomous decision-making.


3.	Predictive models and fraud detection algorithms are integrated into the system.


4.	Hands-on experience collaborating across disciplines in a real-world simulation. 


5.	Understand IC Swift


This project not only enhances technical proficiency but also fosters teamwork and problem-solving abilities.
