### Data science defined

Data science combines multiple fields, including statistics, scientific methods, artificial intelligence (AI), and data analysis, to extract value from data. Those who practice data science are called data scientists, and they combine a range of skills to analyze data collected from the web, smartphones, customers, sensors, and other sources to derive actionable insights.

### Tools & Technologies

-	Python/R: For exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling.
-	Pandas/NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis libraries.
-	Scikit-Learn/TensorFlow: Machine learning frameworks for fraud detection and forecasting.
-	LLM Integration: For agentic AI reasoning and decision-making.

### Methodology

-	Agile Development: Bi-weekly sprints with presentations to demonstrate progress.
-	Version Control: Git/GitHub for collaborative development.
-	Testing Frameworks: JUnit for unit testing, Selenium for UI testing.

Data Scientists
-	Role: Analyze transactional data, build predictive models, and deliver actionable insights.
-	Tasks:
      -	Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on transaction patterns, spending behavior, and risk indicators.
-	Develop predictive models for:
      -	Forecasting income vs. expenses.
      -	Detecting “spreading” (large inflow followed by rapid outflows).
      -	Identifying high-risk accounts.
      -	Provide a fraud detection API that flags suspicious transactions in real time.
-	Interaction Points:
      -	Share insights and models with Developers for integration into the system.
      -	Collaborate with AI Engineers to refine agentic AI decision-making.
